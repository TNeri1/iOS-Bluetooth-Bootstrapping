# iOS-Bluetooth-Bootstrapping

### Overview

This is my next approach to learning Bluetooth Programming. Last time I have been learning how to program Bluetooth Low Energy in C using Segger Embedded Studio and the nrf52840 DK and nrf52840 Dongle.

In this project I wanted to take a high-level approach to Bluetooth Low Energy by utilizing the Bluetooth Core Framework from Apple to make a simple app that can show a simple use of bluetooth. This project is part of a series of projects I am doing to understand Bluetooth Low Energy on a deeper level.

##### Project Description:

The title of this project is Bootstrapping which taught me how to get user approval to use the Bluetooth features of my iPhone 12 pro.

##### Purpose:

The purpose of writing this software is foundational in helping me to understand how Central Devices work on a high level
